# Summon AEC

# Check Values

# Store Values

## Example Usage
##
## /scoreboard players set Id Effect 5
## /scoreboard players set Amplifier Effect 2
## /scoreboard players set Duration Effect 600
## /scoreboard players set SP_SI_A Effect 010
## /execute as @a run function util:effect
## Id = 5 = Strength
## Amplifier = 2 = Strength III
## Duration = 600t = 30s = Strength III for 30 seconds
## SP_SI_A = 010; SP = 0, SI = 1, A = 0; ShowParticles = 0, ShowIcon = 1, Ambient = 0
##
## Gives Strength III for 30 seconds to all players without particles, but shows the icon
##
##
## Usage
##
## Id/Amplifier/Duration are set like in /effect
## SP_SI_A is a list of 3 booleans for: Show Particles (SP), ShowIcon (SI) and Ambient (A) 
##
## ShowParticles: Removes particles if set to 0
## ShowIcon: Shows the Icon in the top right corner of the screen independent of the other values
## Ambient: Makes the icon be surrounded by a blue border and if ShowParticles is enabled shows the particles but they are barely visible
##
## If the effect isn't applied because players move to quickly, try increasing Radius in the summon command
